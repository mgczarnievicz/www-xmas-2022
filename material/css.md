# What is CSS?

CSS means Cascading Stylesheets. While HTML defines the structure and semantics of your content, we use CSS for design and layout.

- Selector: A CSS selector is used to specify the elements to which CSS rules apply.
- Property: Name for a particular property to which a value is attributed.
- Value: The value we assign to a property.
- Declaration: Each pair of property and value is a declaration.

Our selector can be:

- tag: `tagName`
- class: `.className`
- id: `#idName`

## Example

```css
h1 {
    font-size: 30px;
}

.section-name {
    background-color: green;
}

#id-name {
    border: 2px solid blue;
}
```

Because the combination is endless, for today we are only going to use class selectors.
