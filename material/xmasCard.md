# Steps to create you own X-mas Card

To build your own card we are going to start with the template code. To access it go to home -> Material -> Xmas Card.
This will open a new window / tab.

# Code Structure

Starting off with the blank project, let's take a short look at the structure and what we're about to build.

```js

│   └── style.css // preferably this file
├── images // the images we're going to pick from unless you want to upload your own.
│          // That image should also go here.

# Design our card

We want our card to have:

1. Front: This is where we are going to put a photo
2. Back: This is where we will write our whishes

![Semantics](../img/material/cardExample.png)

We have three classes predefined:

- `.card`
- `.front`
- `.back`

So we will want our main tag to have the class `.card`. Then inside of it we will want 2 different sections, one with the class `.front` and the other `.back`.

The section with the class `.front` is going to be our front so inside this section we should add what we want to be in the front of our card. Some title and an image.

The section with the class `.back` is going to be the back of our card. Here we want to put some nice text for our loved ones.

Up until now your code should look like this:

```html
<main class="card">
    <section class="front">
        <!-- Inside here we want to add our front of the card  -->
    </section>
    <section class="back">
        <!-- Inside here we want to add our back of the card. -->
    </section>
</main>
```

Nothing should change because we haven't imported the premade classes.

# Adding some elements

## Front section

In here we want to add a title. Lets do it as an `h1` tag.

Example:

```html
<section class="front">
    <h1>Happy Holidays!</h1>
</section>
```

## Back section

In here we want to write a message. This one we can for example divide in three parts.

1. The greeting
2. The content
3. The closing remarks and signature.

We want the greeting to have more importance than the context so for this we can use an `h2` tag whereas for the content and closing we can use a p tag.

Example:

```html
<section class="back">
    <h2>Dear Mary</h2>
    <p>
        Wishing you love, light, and laughter for Christmas and the New Year
        too!
    </p>
    <p>Cheers, XOXO</p>
</section>
```

## Styling our front and back elements

The simplest way to style different parts of the page is adding a class to each element or styling by section.

Example:

### By section / block

- We are not adding any more classes to the elements, we are going to add a property to the element that contains what we want to style. Be aware that ALL elements in this block will change.

```css
.card {
    font-family: "Caveat";
}
```

### Adding new classes to each element

- In our HTML

```html
<main class="card">
    <section class="front">
        <h1 class="headline">Happy Holidays!</h1>
    </section>
    <section class="back">
        <
        <h2>Dear Mary</h2>
        <p>
            Wishing you love, light, and laughter for Christmas and the New Year
            too!
        </p>
        <p>Cheers, XOXO</p>
    </section>
</main>
```

- In our CSS

```css
.headline {
    font-family: "Mountains of Christmas";
    color: maroon;
}
```

### Importing a CSS file

To add the predefined classes we need to import the file where these classes are defined.
This should be our first line in our CSS file.

```css
@import url("/.there-be-dragons/global.css");
```

Now we don't see any more the back of our card but that is what we want.

## Adding funtionality

Now we see the front of our card but when we click nothing happens.
The functionality of the `click` needs to be added in a JavaScript file.
Because this requires more knowledge we pre define that function. All we need to do is to import it and execute it.

### Steps

1. Let's go to our `script.js` in js folder
2. We must import the function so we can use it. From where? From the file `sketch.js`

```js
import { createCardFlip } from "/.there-be-dragons/sketch.js";
```

3. We must invoque the function so this runs.

```js
createCardFlip();
```

Now lets see our card. Let's click in it and see how it flips.
Now we are able to see the back!

## Adding a nice image

If we want to add an image in the front we need to use the tag `<img>`. This tag requires a `src`, this is the name of the file and where it is located.
Another attribute that is required is the `alt` for accessibility!, this is the description of the image that is used for screen readers.

Because we want the image to cover our front, we prepare one class `.postcardimage` that we should add to our image.

Our code should look like this:

```html
<img
    class="postcardimage"
    src="/images/christmas-lights.jpg"
    alt="christmas postcard image"
/>
```

Now our front has a background Image.
Our headline doesn't look good yet, so let's style it some more.

Let's create a new class in our CSS.

```css
.contrasted {
    text-shadow: 5px 4px black;
}
```

Now let's add this class to our headline too. How do we do this? In our HTML where we added the class `headline`, we add a space and add `contrasted`.

Your code should look like:

```html
<section class="front">
    <h1 class="headline contrasted">Happy Christmas!</h1>
    <img
        class="postcardimage"
        src="/images/christmas-lights.jpg"
        alt="christmas tree"
    />
</section>
```

You can also add this style to headline instead of creating a new class.

## Adding snow

To add the animation of the falling snow we need to:

1. Create a new HTML element in the end of our font section. This should have the class `snowfall`

```html
<section class="front">
    <h1 class="headline contrasted">Happy Christmas!</h1>
    <img
        class="postcardimage"
        src="/images/christmas-lights.jpg"
        alt="christmas tree"
    />
    <div class="snowfall"></div>
</section>
```

2. We need to import a new function in our JS file called `createSnowfall`

```js
import { createCardFlip, createSnowfall } from "/.there-be-dragons/sketch.js";

createCardFlip();
createSnowfall();
```

Now our card is finished! We can improve it with some more styling.
